# Python Calculator


This is a simple calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with parentheses support for complex expressions.

# Features


Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.


Support for parentheses to evaluate complex expressions.


Clear button to reset the calculation field.


Error handling for invalid expressions.


# How to Use


Installation: No installation is required as long as you have Python installed on your system. This application uses Python's built-in Tkinter library, which is available by default in most Python installations.

# Running the Calculator:

1.Simply execute the Python script calculator.py.


2.The calculator window will open, allowing you to perform calculations.

# Performing Calculations:

1.Click on the numeric buttons (0-9) to input numbers.


2.Use the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform arithmetic operations.


3.Parentheses buttons are provided for grouping expressions.


4.Press the equals (=) button to evaluate the expression.


The clear (C) button resets the calculation field.


# Developer Notes

1.The application logic is implemented in calculator.py.


2.User interface layout and design are handled using Tkinter widgets.


3.Error handling is implemented to catch and display errors for invalid expressions.


4.The eval() function is used to evaluate expressions. Care should be taken to validate user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.


# Requirements


1.Python 3.x


2.Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
